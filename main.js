let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    data = jsonData;
}

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {

    };
}

console.log(data);

/* The very first thing that we do on line 1 is to create a new instance of the XMLHttpRequest object.
Then we have the xhr.open() method, and the first argument that we parse in is "GET".
Since in this instance we want to retrieve data from the Star Wars API, then we're going to use the GET method.
The second argument is the URL that we want to retrieve.
We're making a request to the Star Wars API.
And then we do xhr.send() to send the request.

The main chunk of what's going on in this piece of code is in this onreadystatechange() function.
The xhr object maintains an internal state as it's completing various parts of our request operation.
And "readyState = 4" means that the operation has been completed.
Then we're looking at an HTTP status code.
The HTTP status code of 200 means "OK".
So the HTTP status code of 200 means "request succeeded, content delivered'.
That's what we're checking for in our function here.
So once everything is okay, we then use some JavaScript to getElementById() from the DOM and change its innerHTML to the response text that comes back from our xhr object.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

/*This XMLHttpRequest object is an inbuilt object that JavaScript provides to allow us to consume APIs and gives us the method to open connections, to send connections, and close them.*/
/*Now we want to create a new function: xhr.onreadystatechange().
And whenever the state changes of our xhr object, we want to run a check.
If the ready state is equal to 4 and the status is 200, then what we want to do is use JavaScript to do document.getElementByID() and retrieve our data div.
And then we're going to change the innerHTML to be equal to the response text that comes back from our xhr object.
*/

/*
xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
        document.getElementById("data").innerHTML = this.responseText;
    }
};

Now that we have this listener waiting to see for xhr's state to change, I need to open a connection.
So I do xhr.open().
I parse in the GET() method, which is what we want to use.
And then I parse in the URL, which in this case is "http://www.swapi.co/api/".


xhr.open("GET", "https://ci-swapi.herokuapp.com/api/");

And now I use xhr.send().
So when the state changes, we'll check to see if the ready state is 4. We'll discuss what these states and statuses mean in the next video.
But basically, we can say that it means that if everything went well, then we're going to get a div ID of "data", and put the response text in it.


xhr.send();

Let's go back to our index.html and run it.
When we do, we can see that we have this JSON object that's been put inside our div.
So that's working as we expected.

Why doesn't our "console.log(data)" work?
Well there's a very good reason for this which is that the "onreadystatechange" function only sets the data variable to contain the response text when the ready state equals 4 and the status equals 200.
Our function has been called five times by the time that our data variable is set, whereas our "console.log" is only ever called once.
And that will be right after we've run "xhr.send".
So this means that when we run "console.log(data)", it doesn't have anything in there yet.
Data is not set until after "console.log" has been called, which is why we're getting a response of undefined.
Now if I were to move my "console.log" data into line 10, just after where we set the variable, then it works fine.
Let's just go and confirm that.
Refresh our page and, as we can see, we have our response text.
The problem with this is it means that all of the work we need to do with data would have to be done inside the "xhr.onreadystatechange" function, which could make things really messy and complicated because all of the code for our application could potentially end up inside this function.
So how do we get the data out of here?
Well one thing that we could do is create a separate function.
And we can parse our data to that function.
So I'm just going to delete my "console.log" here.
And then I'm going to create a new function, which is called "setData".
I use my parentheses here and open a curly brace.
And then I'll say that "data =".
We'll call it JSON data, so I need to actually parse that into the function.
So "jsonData".
And that's the name of the variable that I will pass in to the parentheses of the function here.
So now then what I just need to do is call my function "setData".
And I need to put "JSON.parse" and then "this.responseText" inside the brackets for "JSON.parse".
So I'll just put that in there.
So this will be sending through a JSON parsed object into our setData function.
Now if I "console.log" my data, put a semicolon, save the file, and refresh the page, then now we can see that we get our JSON object, which we can expand just as we did before.
This is also called deserializing our JSON.
But we have the same problem.
If I move "console.log(data)" to the bottom of the file, it goes back to being undefined again.
So that means that everything for our function could now end up in the setData function.
We've just moved the problem away by one step.
JavaScript has a number of ways of dealing with this: timeouts and callbacks.
In our next video, we'll have a look at how a timeout works.
